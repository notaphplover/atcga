If heads, that player searches his or her deck for a Basic Pokémon and puts it onto his or her Bench. If the player does, he or she may search his or her deck for a Pokémon Tool card and attach it to that Pokémon. If that player searched his or her deck, the player shuffles his or her deck afterward."
