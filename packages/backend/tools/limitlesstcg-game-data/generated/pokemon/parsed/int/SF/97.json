Whenever your opponent flips a coin for the Special Condition Burned between turns, treat it as tails./Once at the end of your turn, if Heatran is on your Bench, you may use this power. If you discarded basic Energy cards attached to your [R] or [M] Active Pokémon by using that Pokémon's attack this turn, attach up to 2 of those Energy cards to that Pokémon."
